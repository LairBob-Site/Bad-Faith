<p class="summary">In the 1970s and '80s, French historian and philosopher named Michel Foucault examined history as a collective <strong>story</strong>, and not as an objective list of facts. That perspective has not only changed how we think about culture -- it exposes some deep implications of new social tools.</p>

<div class="PH-note">
  <h2>Post Summary</h2>
  <h3>Context: Foucault and the Discourse</h3>
  <p>Michel Foucault studied the public exchange of ideas within a society -- what he called "the discourse". To him, that ongoing narrative actively defines our culture, and who we are as individuals.</p>

  <h3>Consequence: A New Discourse Is Writing Itself...in SQL</h3>
  <p>New technologies like "collaborative filtering" are allowing a new kind of discourse to arise...the first that can now operate outside of what we consciously think and do.</p>

<h3>Conclusions: The Implications of a New Discourse</h3>
<p>Those changes aren't intrinsically good or bad, but they raise very specific issues for us to take into account.</p>
</div>

<div class="PH-image"><p >-- IMAGE OF MICHEL FOUCAULT --</p></div>

<h3>The Collective Conversation</h3>

<p>Foucault focused on what he called <em>le discours</em> ("the discourse") -- the huge, shared discussion that takes place across an entire society, in public or in semi-privacy. Newspapers, textbooks, movies and any other public communication all come together into a larger conversation: the story of a culture.</p>
<p>Moreover, when he looked at that public discourse, Foucault saw a lot more structure and patterns than you might expect, and he saw a deeper level of influence on our personal beliefs than we might want to admit. He saw the discourse as a centralized mechanism that guides our thinking, by setting the terms of what we think <em>about</em>.</p>


<h3>All we are...is what we <u>say</u></h3>
<p>For Foucault, that was an especially powerful idea, because he saw "language" and "thought" as the same thing. He didn't believe that there is some kind of deeper, essential "self" buried within each of us, beneath the level of our own internal monologues. To a post-modern thinker like Foucault, that self-spawning narrative in your head -- that second-to-second story you tell yourself about what you're doing, and what you're thinking -- isn't something that a mythical deeper self is "doing". That internal stream of language <em>is</em> your consciousness, and there's no "you" outside the words of that story.</p>

<p>It's easy to see, then, why Foucault's exploration of the larger, external conversation became so central to post-modernism. Our own internal stories obviously can't spawn in a vacuum, and if there's no "self" involved to tell the story, there's only one way for the process to start. In their view, each of us really only starts -- and then maintains -- our own internal narrative as a <em>reaction</em> to the larger discussion around us. Our conscious selves couldn't exist without it, and the content of our internal stories is almost completely defined by it.</p>

[slider title="More on Foucault and post-modernism --"]
<p class="PH-draft">I'm going to add a little more detail on Foucault and the context around him. (Also, I want to give a bit of background about his personal life -- he kind of unraveled towards the end of his life, and ended up dying of AIDS. Anyone who's studied him will be aware of that.)</p>
[/slider]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foucault also saw that powerful, self-preserving forces move through the discourse. Many of those forces work to encourage consistent thoughts, cooperative behavior and, most importantly, a <strong>coherent story</strong>. "Religion", "censorship", "celebrity", "citizenship"...whether or not concepts like these directly control <em>what</em> we think, they definitely play a huge role in defining what we think <em>about</em>.</p>
<p>That's not to say that those forces are intrinsically bad. No society could exist without them. One of the most important functions they perform is to help filter out complexity -- to make it easier to figure out what's going on, and to decide what to do about it. That happens in two ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The discourse acts as a gatekeeper, by encouraging access to some information and ideas (and making it much harder to be exposed to others).</li>
  <li>Within the realm of those ideas we're exposed to, the discourse supports us in acting decisively. It provides guidance for our decision-making, and models for how to follow through.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's important to keep in mind that -- that level -- the discourse is basically amoral. It is what allows us to act collectively, whether our actions represents the best or the worst that our culture has to offer.</p>

<h2>A New Discourse Is Writing Itself...in SQL</h2>
<p class="summary">So what does this have to do with social channels? New technologies are allowing the discourse to operate on a new level -- a level that's much farther outside our conscious control.</p>

<p>Until now, while the public discourse has always lived outside of any given person, it has always been defined and applied through <em>people</em>. Even though most of the public discussion takes place through writing, the decisions of <em>what</em> to write -- and whether to write at all -- are made by people.</p>

<p class="PH-image"> -- IMAGE OF THOUGHTFUL BUREAUCRATS -- </p>

<p>Collaborative filtering, however, creates a narrative that is genuinely different. This new discourse doesn't need us to consciously participate in the writing process...or in how that process alters our world.</p>

<p class="PH-note">EXPLANATION: What are "collaborative filters"? (And what is "SQL")?</p>

<h3>What's So Different About An Automated Discourse?</h3>
<p class="PH-draft">An automatic record...</p>

<h3>A Hammer Isn't A Weapon...Till You Smack Someone In The Head With It</h3>
<p class="PH-draft">Although many of these tools are being implemented by government and commercial institutions, the issue isn't just whether or not filters give those institutions a new, more direct opportunity to influence our experience. (They do. They definitely do.)</p>

                    Brilliant, man. Just brilliant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I did think of one issue that you
                    haven&#8217;t yet addressed, a huge issue
                    that would probably merit one of
                    those&#8211;again, brilliant&#8211;graphic
                    rest stops that you&#8217;re fond of, an
                    issue that has contributed more to the
                    Internet than Amazon and Facebook combined,
                    an issue that WILL impede the Like
                    juggernaut.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Porn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not just porn, actually, but any site that
                    with which we do and yet do not want to be
                    associated. Man&#8217;s inherent duality
                    demands not only an illusion of online
                    privacy but also that the Internet afford us
                    more than a single identity. As Joe Browser
                    becomes aware of the ramifications of
                    clicking Like, he&#8217;ll become more and
                    more hesitant to do so. It comes down to Like
                    vs. privacy, and any future paradigm must
                    consider both.

                        Point definitely taken. I&#8217;m still
                        working out how I want to pull together
                        my thoughts on that front, but one of the
                        things I want to dig into are the
                        parallel issues around the idea of a
                        &#8220;self&#8221; &#8212; the added
                        leverage that we may (or may not) see
                        around our online identity won&#8217;t
                        come from having some some, single static
                        &#8220;me&#8221; emerge. If it comes at
                        all, it&#8217;s going to come from our
                        ability to _control_ who we are &#8212;
                        in any given context &#8212; from a
                        central point.

                  Thinking really hard about an idea doesn't make
                  you a traitor, and it doesn't make you a
                  partisan. It makes you smart.

                  If you think I'm betraying your morals by
                  paying careful attention to something that
                  pisses you off, you should stop reading right
                  now. It will make us both much happier.

                  OTOH, no coherent discussion can account for
                  everything. An examination carried out in good
                  faith isn't "wrong" because it sets aside an
                  important issue. At worst, it's incomplete. At
                  best, it's disciplined.

                  &#8220;D&#8221;, than I am with the ones who
                  start with &#8220;R&#8221;, or &#8220;T&#8221;.

                  &#8220;The Perfect is the enemy of the
                  Good&#8221;: A recent NYT article about
                  &#8220;lean startups&#8221; brought a lot of
                  different thoughts to mind for me. The actual
                  focus of the article is moderately interesting,
                  but more importantly, it raises a core question
                  around balancing (a) the need and desire for
                  perfection, against (b) actually getting
                  something _done_.
